QtWayland scanner;s home is inside QtWayland in Qt (https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtwayland.git/tree/src/qtwaylandscanner)

We have a temporary fork to deliver some crucial fixes that are affecting our code that is not released in Qt5.15, including an API change which can't be relied upon via patching.

Patches should still go via upstream to Qt and be "cherry-picked" here.

This folder should be dropped in Plasma 6
